Hi, as you may have already guessed, my name is Andy Ho. I’m currently a 4th year Computer Science student at Ryerson University. Throughout my time at Ryerson, I have taken on various co-op roles through the GTA and am currently looking for new grad positions in anticipation for my upcoming graduation in the spring of 2021. 

Throughout my time working as a co-op at various companies, I have been able to attain a wide skill set ranging from development of pieces of software to aid in simplifying processes for team members, to leading and coordinating several company-wide coordination efforts that impacted hundreds and thousands of employees, to learning seemingly basic people skills. 

Starting from a young age, I’ve had a strong passion for working with technology as well as meeting new people. Going forward, I want to continue to foster these passions into something even greater. Something I can look back on. Something to invest in. And most importantly, something to be proud of. 

Whether it is for my professional experience, my thoughts, or if you’re just passing by, it is my hope that you, the reader gain something out of this visit. 

Thanks for reading!

Andy
